III Brief Introduction Of Structure
The equipment is made up of the following parts
1. “8” is made from 45# steel plate, “1” in the plane with scale left it with “3” and “4”.
2. “5” is parallel to the main lever, it is driven by a reversible motor and rotates, and move the “6” on the main lever.
3. The pillar(“13”) plays a major role in supporting.
4. The lower jig can lift the lifting screw up and down with the help of the hand wheel
IV Installation
1. Unboxing
1.1 Open the outer packing and remove the plastic film cover.
1.2 Take out the main and secondary levers, the host and other parts. Then remove the wrapping paper and do a good job of cleaning and dedusting.
2. Installation location and environmental requirements
2.1 Please install the equipment on a solid platform. The indoor temperature is from 17 to 25 degrees centigrade
2.2 Avoid the intrusion of water vapor and corroded gas.
3. How to install the equipment
3.1 Put the equipment on the workbench and adjust the level.
3.2 The main lever assembly is mounted on the bracket, and then the suspension component and the auxiliary lever are connected.
V Operating Methods And Service Regulations
1.Operation methods
1.1 Please connect the equipment to the power supply.
1.2 Zero point adjustment.
1.3 Cleaning up the sundries on the folding clamp, then put the test body in the folding clamp. Rotate the wheel to clamp the test body, so that the main lever will have an elevation angle.
1.4 Press the start button to show the light. The motor drives the wire rod. Block moving load. When loading to a certain value, the body is broken, the main lever connecting plate is pressed, the micro switch motor is stopped, and the motor stops. The flexural strength will be displayed on the main lever scale.
1.5 Press the “7” button to push “6” back to zero and prepare for the next experiment.
2. Service regulations
After the test is finished, we need to turn off the power and make the “6” return to zero.
VI Maintenance And Troubleshooting Of Equipment
1. Maintenance of equipment
（1） The equipment is forbidden to use in corrosive gas and strong magnetic field.
（2）When the device does not work with a cloth cover please. This is done to prevent the dust from invading.
（3）The knife and the knife pad on the device should be used on a regular basis with anhydrous alcohol scrub silk. This is done to prevent dust and oil contamination at the contacting part of the blade.
2. Usual malfunction eliminating
（1）If the power switch indicator is not lighted, check whether the fuse is burned.
（2）If the main lever on the device is not flexibly swinging, it should be checked whether the knife is in the middle of the knife seat.
（3）The failure of the block button should be the screw or spring of the price difference button part.
VII Supporting Components
1. The box is equipped with a main engine, a main lever assembly, a sub lever assembly, a set of upper fixtures, a positioning plate.
2. A copy of the product instructions attached to the equipment.
