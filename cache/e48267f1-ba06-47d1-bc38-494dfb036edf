For example, if we set the relative humidity control value SH to 90%, the upper limit relative value \"HH\" is set to 2%, the lower relative value \"HL\" is set to 2%, and the return difference \"HA\" is set to 1%.Then when the humidity is less than 88%, start humidification humidifier. When the humidity is not less than 89%, the device will stop humidification.
